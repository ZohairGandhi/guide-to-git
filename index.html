        <h1>Guide to Git for the Relatively Clueless</h1>

        <p>
          So, you've started studying programming and have finally had enough of
          pretending to know what's happening when people talk about Git. This
          might just be the guide for you, young Padawan. This guide will help
          you set up Git and learn enough of the basics to start feeling a
          little more in the loop the next time your friends start speaking
          Greek.
        </p>

        <aside>
          This guide assumes that you are somewhat familiar with using the
          terminal. If not, you may want to learn some of the basics of using
          the command line. Trust me, it will open doors beyond just using Git
          from the terminal. You could even use a terminal editor and one-up
          your friends.
        </aside>

        <h2 id="git-setup">Git: The Setup</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Why did the programmer break up with Git?</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Before we begin, a quick distinction: Git is <i>not</i> the same as
          GitHub. Git is the actual version control system (VCS) that tracks
          your changes, whereas GitHub is a platform that hosts Git repositories
          and where Gits come together to enjoy a song and a drink.
        </p>

        <h3>Install Git</h3>

        <p>
          Head over to the
          <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads"
            >Downloads page on the Git website</a
          >
          and follow the instructions to install Git for your operating system.
          I'll wait here.
        </p>

        <h3>Set Up Your Details</h3>

        <p>
          Hey, welcome back! Now that you've (hopefully) successfully installed
          Git, let's set up your user details. These details are included with
          each commit to track who was responsible for a change so you can blame
          them when they break the codebase.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you're a MacOS or Linux user, launch the terminal application.
          Windows users, launch the Git BASH emulator that should have come
          packaged with your Git install.
        </p>

        <aside>
          While I have you here Windows users, I must warn you that your future
          is going to be a little more frustrating than MacOS and Linux users.
          Developer tooling just seems to work a little less painfully on
          Unix-based systems. While the Windows experience isn't <i>too</i> bad,
          if you do get frustrated in the future, you may want to consider
          dual-booting Linux, using a virtual machine or using the Windows
          Subsystem for Linux.
        </aside>

        <p>
          Typically, you shouldn't blindly execute terminal commands from the
          Internet, but you can trust me (Can I borrow a cool $500?). These
          commands are going to configure the user details for your local Git
          install. When executing these commands, keep the quotes, but replace
          the contents inside with your own details.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-bash">
git config --global user.name "Peter Parker"
git config --global user.email "peter.parker@dailybugle.com"
    </code></pre>

        <h2 id="git-punchline">Git: The Punchline</h2>

        <blockquote>
          <p>Because they couldn't commit!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          You've likely worked on an assignment and saved multiple copies of it
          as
          <code>assignment_draft.docx</code>,
          <code>assignment_final.docx</code> and
          <code>assignment_final_final.docx</code>. With each edit, you probably
          wanted to save the new version while still keeping the previous ones
          in case you wanted to come back to them.
        </p>

        <p>
          This type of versioning can get out of hand when you want to store
          versions of <i>multiple</i> files. It's also inefficient because each
          new version contains the contents of the <i>entire</i> file, even the
          parts that haven't changed since the last version.
        </p>

        <p>
          This can be resolved using a VCS Ã  la Git. When you save in Git, only
          the changes since the previous version are recorded and added to a
          history of all previous versions. Like a time machine, Git lets you go
          back to previous versions, compare changes and even revert to earlier
          versions.
        </p>

        <aside>
          <p>
            Git is a distributed version control system, which is one of three
            main types of such systems.
          </p>

          <h3>Local Version Control</h3>

          <p>
            In a local VCS, changes are managed and stored directly on the local
            machine. If you use Git locally&mdash;without hosting your
            repository on a remote server&mdash;it behaves as a local VCS.
          </p>

          <p>
            A local VCS doesn't really make it easy to share code with
            collaborators and if your machine fails, you may lose all your data.
            From experience, that is not enjoyable at all.
          </p>

          <h3>Centralised Version Control</h3>

          <p>
            These improve upon local systems by featuring a single, central
            server that hosts all versions of the project files. Individual
            developers have their own copies of the project but must connect to
            their server to retrieve the latest version and commit their
            changes.
          </p>

          <p>
            This makes collaboration easier and reduces the risk of losing data
            due to failure of the local machine. But wait...what happens if the
            server goes down?
          </p>

          <h3>Distributed Version Control</h3>

          <p>
            We finally arrive at the next iteration of version control. In
            addition to a central server that hosts the entire project,
            distributed version control lets each developer clone the entire
            repository to their local machine&mdash;allowing them to work
            without requiring constant connection with the server.
          </p>

          <p>
            You can commit changes to your local repository and when ready to
            push your changes or get others', you can interact with the central
            server. This makes collaboration possible, eliminates the single
            point of failure and lets you have a moment to think before you
            decide if you
            <i>really</i> want to push that change to the central repository.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you'd like to read more about version control, I recommend

        <h2 id="github">
          Time to Address the GitHub-Shaped Elephant in the Room
        </h2>

        <p>
          While Git is a standalone piece of software, in practice you will
          likely be using it in conjunction with GitHub or another platform
          providing hosting for Git repositories. It just so happens that GitHub
          is widely used. So, let's finally set up your GitHub profile.
        </p>

        <p>
          Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub website</a> and
          create an account. Again, I'll wait.
        </p>

        <p>
          Back already? Geez, can I have a break? Anyway, now that you've
          created a GitHub account, you need to link it to your local machine,
          so you don't have to log in with your credentials each time you want
          to interact with the remote. This can be done by creating an SSH key
          pair which consists of two cryptographically linked files.
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Private key: A secret key that'll reside on your local machine. It's
            like a digital password only known to the machine.
          </li>
          <li>
            Public key: A key you can share with remote servers like GitHub.
            It's like a digital lock that will only unlock when the machine
            attempting to connect provides the corresponding private key.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Run the following command to generate an SSH key. Press
          <kbd>Enter</kbd> through all the prompts.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-bash">
ssh-keygen
    </code></pre>

        <p>
          You can view the generated key using the following command. Leave the
          terminal open as you will come back to this output in a moment.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-bash">
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
    </code></pre>

        <p>
          Log into your GitHub profile and navigate to the "SSH and GPG keys"
          section under the Settings. Click the button to create a new SSH key
          and give it a name that describes the device this key is associated
          with. Copy the output of your public key from the terminal, paste it
          into the field on GitHub and click the button to add the key.
          Congratulations, you now wield a modicum of power in your hands.
        </p>

        <h2 id="joyride">Take Git for a Joyride</h2>

        <p>
          Let's see what a simple Git workflow looks like. Create a new
          repository from your GitHub account and name it something
          descriptive&mdash;for example, <code>learning-git</code>. Once the
          repository is created, click the Code button, then the SSH option and
          copy the link to your repository.
        </p>

        <p>
          In your terminal, navigate to the directory where you would like to
          clone this repository and run the following command.
        </p>

        <pre><code class="language-bash">
git clone your-repo-link
    </code></pre>

        <p>
          This will create a copy of your repository on your local machine by
          creating a directory with the same name. Inside this directory, create
          a file called <code>baby_steps.txt</code> and run
          <code>git status</code>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Git will tell you that file is untracked. Now is a good time to
          introduce the Holy Trinity of Git trees: the HEAD, the Staging Area
          and the Working Directory. Your file is currently in the Working
          Directory&mdash;the place where files are initially as they are being
          edited.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you are ready to commit, run <code>git add baby_steps.txt</code>.
          This moves the file from the Working Directory to the Staging
          Area&mdash;a kind of waiting room for files before they are sent on
          their way. Running <code>git status</code> now will tell you that this
          file is now a change to be committed.
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's put the therapy to good use and finally commit. Run
          <code>git commit -m "Take first step towards learning Git"</code> to
          commit these changes. The <code>-m</code> flag tells Git that this
          commit will have an associated message which is provided in quotes.
          There's plenty of advice online about writing good commit messages,
          but all I'll recommend is to be succinct and meaningful. For example,
          do not write a message such as "propah progress", which is a commit
          message I have actually seen.
        </p>

        <p>
          Upon committing, Git will create a snapshot of the files in the
          Staging Area and record it in history. HEAD will be updated to this
          latest commit and the Staging Area and Working Directory will be left
          clean once again. Your local repository is now one commit ahead of the
          remote since the changes haven't been pushed yet. Running
          <code>git log</code> will show you the commit history for this
          repository along with details such as the time of the commit and the
          person responsible for this egregiousness.
        </p>

        <p>
          When you're ready to push your changes to the remote, run
          <code>git push origin main</code>.
        </p>

        <h2 id="branch">Branch Out a Bit</h2>

        <p>
          By default, a repository has a single branch called
          <code>main</code> and your commits are added onto this branch.
          However, Git allows you to create other branches and have multiple
          different versions of your project existing at the same time. Very
          Christopher Nolan-esque. To create a branch, run
          <code>git branch branch-name</code> and then
          <code>git checkout branch-name</code> to switch to this branch so that
          future commits apply onto it.
        </p>

        <p>
          To see all the branches in your repository, run
          <code>git branch</code>. Your current branch is typically shown with
          an asterisk. Once you've made some commits on a branch and want to
          apply the changes to main, follow these steps:
        </p>

        <ol>
          <li>
            Change back to <code>main</code> with <code>git checkout main</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Run <code>git merge branch-name</code> to merge the changes from the
            other branch into <code>main</code>
          </li>
          <li>
            Trim those extra branches (if not needed) with
            <code>git branch -d branch-name</code>
          </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          If the same file has been changed in different ways on separate
          branches, you will run into a merge conflict when attempting these
          steps. In such a case, you'll have to sit back as the branches battle
          to the death and only the victor remains. If you're not into watching
          branches fight each other for sport, you can simply resolve the merge
          conflict yourself.
          <a
            href="https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/addressing-merge-conflicts/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line"
            >This page from GitHub's documentation</a
          >
          does a better job of explaining this than I possibly can, so I'm just
          linking to it. I know, I'm disappointed in me too.
        </p>

        <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
          You should now be able to use Git more or less productively. The
          commands covered here tend to make up most of the daily workflow and I
          hope that you've learnt enough to discover the rest yourself. There
          are
          <i>many</i> more topics to be covered and I'll hopefully get to them
          at some point in the future (Don't hold me to that though). Hopefully,
          now you can stop acting like you know what your friends are talking
          about and start <i>barely</i>
          understanding what they're talking about.
